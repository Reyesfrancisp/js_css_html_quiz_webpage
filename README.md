# Quiz Webpage| JS, CSS, HTML

## Coding Quiz Page by Francis Reyes

## Description
The goal of this webpage was to start out with a completely empty file to create quiz website from scratch. The main tools used here were javascript functions, timers, accessing the DOM and manipulating the variables based off of user inputs. The code includes various tricks with labeling parts of the page, hiding and showing certain parts as the code executes. There is also a lot of randomization done with the quiz questions so that the questions get rearranged. The layout and structuring was mainly done through the display flexboxes. Timers are set to handle events based off time and functions handle certain user interaction events. Styling was done through the CSS classes and the HTML structure was based off of hwo I wanted the page to look. There were many steps in the project to get the website working how I wanted it to and is shown by the various commits.

## Usage
Start by clicking the generate quiz button in green to begin a new quiz. The red button deletes your information from local storage which stores your time, high score, and name. This can be viewed under the inspect tool, under applications, and under the current local storage associated with the webpage to find an array of objects that stores each attempt.

## Roadmap
I plan on adding more features and functions to the quiz page if time allows. I have several ideas to display scores and even randomize the answers to the questions so that it is all randomized.
